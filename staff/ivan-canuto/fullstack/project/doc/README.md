# App

## Intro

This application is a social network that allows users to share text content on various topics. Additionally, it features a chatbot function where users can interact with an AI to ask questions related to those topics. The text shared on the platform consists of summaries generated by the AI based on the previous user conversation. If a user finds that the generated text needs adjustments, they can easily edit and customize it to their liking.

Among its other functionalities, users can comment on posts by other users, like and save posts, provide suggestions for improvements or report errors in the posted content. Users can also search for posts based on the its title content. Furthermore, the application allows users to conveniently access and view the last 15 posts they visited.
